# gnome-setup

Script to setup my preferred gnome setup. Requires arch.

Currently sets up 4 things:

- Pop Shell: for tiling windows
- Ulauncher: as the app launcher
- Space Bar: workspace indicator on top panel
- Theme: Make GTK3, Qt5 and Qt6 look like Libadwaita
  - Supports both light and dark themes
  - Colliod icon theme in both GTK and Qt
  - Optional Fira Sans as font in GTK3/4 and Qt5/6

The Pop Shell install includes a bunch of keybinds that are different from the default.
